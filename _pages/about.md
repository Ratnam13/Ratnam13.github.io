I am an undergraduate student at BITS Pilani Goa Campus
where I am majoring in Mechanical engineering. My research
interest lies in CAD, 3D printing, CFD and Animation. I have
worked on various projects related to CFD analysis, FEA,
aircraft designing and 3D modeling.
I am an avid aviation enthusiast and love building and flying
airplanes and qudrocopters. Apart from aviation, I am a
voracious reader, an artist and a passionate photographer.
